Tam was a kind and beautiful girl who lost her mother at a young age. 
She lived with her cruel stepmother and her half-sister, Cam. 
Out of jealousy and hatred, Tam was constantly mistreated by her stepmother and Cam.
They forced her to do all the hard work and treated her unfairly in every way. 
Despite her hardships, Tam remained kind-hearted and resilient. 
Each time Tam suffered, the Buddha would appear to comfort and help her, giving her the strength to endure.

One day during a royal festival, the king met Tam and was captivated by her beauty and grace. 
He chose her to be his queen, bringing Tam a brief period of happiness. 
However, driven by deep jealousy and hatred, Cam and her mother devised a cruel plan. 
They murdered Tam and deceitfully placed Cam as the new queen, seizing her place in the palace. 
Tam’s untimely death marked a turning point, but her story did not end there.

Tam reincarnated multiple times—as a golden bird, a starfruit tree, a loom, and finally a persimmon tree. 
In each form, she was repeatedly harmed by Cam and her mother, who feared her return. 
Despite their attempts to destroy her, Tam's spirit endured. 
Eventually, Tam fully returned to human form and reunited with the king. 
They lived happily ever after, and justice was served when Cam and her mother were severely punished for their cruelty.
