Tam was a kind and beautiful girl who lost her mother at a young age.
She lived with her cruel stepmother and her half-sister, Cam.
They forced her to do all the hard work and treated her unfairly.
Despite her hardships, Tam remained kind-hearted and resilient.
Each time Tam suffered, the Buddha would appear to comfort and help her.
