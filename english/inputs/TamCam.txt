Tam was a kind and beautiful girl who lost her mother at a young age. She lived with her cruel stepmother and her half-sister, Cam.
Out of jealousy and hatred, Tam was constantly mistreated by her stepmother and Cam.
Each time Tam suffered, the Buddha would appear to comfort and help her.
One day during a royal festival, the king met Tam and chose her as his queen.
Driven by jealousy, Cam and her mother killed Tam and placed Cam as the new queen.
Tam reincarnated multiple times—as a golden bird, a starfruit tree, a loom, and finally a persimmon tree—but was repeatedly harmed by Cam and her mother.
In the end, Tam reunited with the king, and they lived happily ever after.
Cam and her mother were severely punished for their cruelty.
